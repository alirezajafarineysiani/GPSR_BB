# Cacusality

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the "Gradient Projection for Sparse Reconstruction" algorithm. Originally written in MATLAB by the authors MÃ¡rio Figueiredo, Robert D. Nowak, and Stephen J. Wright, this implementation aims to provide a convenient and accessible version of the algorithm in Python.

## Sparse Recovery Algorithm

Sparse recovery is a fundamental problem in signal processing and related fields, where the goal is to accurately reconstruct a sparse signal from a limited set of measurements. The Gradient Projection for Sparse Reconstruction algorithm is a popular method for achieving this task.

## Getting Started

To use this implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com//alirezajafarineysiani/GPSR_BB.git
