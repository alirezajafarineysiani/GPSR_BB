# Gradient Projection for Sparse Reconstruction (GPSR_BB)

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of the "Gradient Projection for Sparse Reconstruction" (GPSR_BB) algorithm in both Python and C. Originally developed in MATLAB by MÃ¡rio Figueiredo, Robert D. Nowak, and Stephen J. Wright, this project aims to provide convenient and accessible versions of the algorithm in both programming languages.

## Sparse Recovery Algorithm

Sparse recovery is a fundamental problem in signal processing and related fields, where the goal is to accurately reconstruct a sparse signal from a limited set of measurements. The Gradient Projection for Sparse Reconstruction (GPSR_BB) algorithm is a popular method for achieving this task.

The problem is formulated as:

$$ \underset{x}{\text{minimize}} \quad \lVert x \rVert_0 \\
\text{subject to} \quad Ax = b$$
