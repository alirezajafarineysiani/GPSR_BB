# C and Python Implementation of Gradient Projection for Sparse Reconstruction (GPSR) Algorithm

## Overview

Welcome to the GPSR_BB repository, where you can find implementations of the "Gradient Projection for Sparse Reconstruction" (GPSR_BB) algorithm in C and Python. Originally developed in MATLAB by MÃ¡rio Figueiredo, Robert D. Nowak, and Stephen J. Wright, this project aims to provide accessible versions of the algorithm in both programming languages.

## Sparse Recovery Algorithm

Sparse recovery addresses the fundamental problem in signal processing of reconstructing a sparse signal from limited measurements. The GPSR_BB algorithm is widely recognized for its effectiveness in efficiently solving this problem.

The problem can be formulated as:

$$ \underset{\mathbf{x}}{\text{minimize}} \quad \lVert\mathbf{x}\rVert_0 \quad \text{subject to} \quad \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b} $$

where $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the sparse signal to be recovered, $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ (with $m < n$) is the sensing matrix assumed to be full rank, and $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^m$ is the measurement vector.

Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem stated above, approaches based on the relaxation of the $\ell_0$-norm by the $\ell_1$-norm have been proposed. GPSR_BB addresses this through the solution of the lasso problem, defined as:

$$ \underset{\mathbf{x}}{\text{minimize}} \quad \tau \lVert\mathbf{x}\rVert_1 + \lVert\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b}\rVert_2^2 $$

This formulation seeks a sparse solution $\mathbf{x}$ by balancing the sparsity-inducing $\ell_1$-norm regularization with the fidelity term $\lVert\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b}\rVert_2^2$, where $\tau$ is a regularization parameter.

This approach leverages optimization techniques to efficiently recover sparse signals from noisy or incomplete measurements, making it a valuable tool in various signal processing applications.

## Getting Started

To use these implementations, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

#### OpenBLAS Library (for C Implementation)

To build and run the C implementation, you will need the OpenBLAS library version 0.3.27. Here are the steps to install it:

1. **Download OpenBLAS:**
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/releases/download/v0.3.27/OpenBLAS-0.3.27.tar.gz
   ```
   
   

3. **Extract the Archive:**
   ```bash
   tar -xzvf OpenBLAS-0.3.27.tar.gz
   cd OpenBLAS-0.3.27
   ```
   

4. **Configure OpenBLAS:**
   ```bash
   make TARGET=your_architecture
   ```
   
   Replace \`your_architecture\` with your specific architecture (e.g., HASWELL). Supported architectures can be found in the \`TARGET\` folder.

5. **Build and Install OpenBLAS:**
   ```bash
   make
   sudo make install
   ```
   This command installs the library system-wide.

### Cloning the Repository

   Clone the GPSR_BB repository using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alirezajafarineysiani/GPSR_BB.git
   ```

### Building the C Implementation

To build the C implementation (example assuming gcc and OpenBLAS installed):
```bash
gcc main.c -lopenblas -L/opt/OpenBLAS/lib -I/opt/OpenBLAS/include -o main
```

### Running the Executable

You can run the executable with the following command:
```bash
./main n m k
```
- n: Number of measurements.
- m: Dimension of the signal.
- k: Number of non-zero entries in the original signal $\mathbf{x}$.

For example:
```bash
./main 400 1000 10
```
This command runs the program with n = 400, m = 1000, and k = 10, indicating 400 measurements, a signal dimension of 1000, and 10 non-zero entries in the original signal x.


### Using the Python Implementation

The Python implementation is provided as \`gpsr_bb.py\`. You can use it directly in your Python environment.
